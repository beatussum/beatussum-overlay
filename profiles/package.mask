# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and an
# explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely careful
# not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale breakage,
# especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Mattéo Rossillol‑‑Laruelle <beatussum@protonmail.com> (2003-03-29)
## # Masking these versions until we can get the v4l stuff to work properly
## # again.
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# --- Best last rites (removal) practices ---
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Mattéo Rossillol‑‑Laruelle <beatussum@protonmail.com> (2003-03-29)
## # Masked for removal in 15 days. Does not work with new libfoo. Upstream
## # dead, gtk-1, smells funny. (bug #987654)
