# When you add an entry to the top of this file,  add your name,  the date,  and  an
# explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely careful not to
# commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale breakage,  especially
# if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Foo Bar <foo@gentoo.org> (2003-03-29)
## # Masking these versions until we can get
## # the v4l stuff to work properly again.
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# --- Best last rites (removal) practices ---
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Foo Bar <foo@gentoo.org> (2003-03-29)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Does not work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)
