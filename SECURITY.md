# Security policy

I try to take the security of my softwares seriously.
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in [my Gentoo overlay](https://github.com/beatussum/beatussum-overlay/), please report it to me as described below.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by [opening a security advisory](https://github.com/beatussum/beatussum-overlay/security/advisories/new/), or by contacting me at beatussum@protonmail.com.

I will try to answer as soon as possible.
